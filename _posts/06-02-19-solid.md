##  SOLID {#solid}

SOLID is five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.

### Single responsibility principle
> A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.

### Open–closed principle
> Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### Liskov substitution principle
> Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

### Interface segregation principle
> Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

### Dependency inversion principle
> One should depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.
